### Problem

Today we're learning about running time!  

**Task**

A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given a number, n, determine and print whether it's Prime or Not Prime.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.  
Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, n, to be tested for primality.

**Output Format**

For each test case, print whether n is Prime or Not Prime on a new line.

**Sample Input**

```
3
12
5
7
```

**Sample Output**

```
Not prime
Prime
Prime
```
