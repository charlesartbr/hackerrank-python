https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-exceptions-string-to-integer

### Problem

**Objective**  

Today, we're getting started with Exceptions by learning how to parse an integer from a string and print a custom error message.

**Task**

Read a string, S, and print its integer value; if S cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

Note: You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling constructs built into your submission language. If you attempt to use loops/conditional statements, you will get a 0 score.

**Input Format**

A single string, S.

**Output Format**

Print the parsed integer value of S, or Bad String if S cannot be converted to an integer.

**Sample Input 0**

```
3
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
3
```

**Sample Input 1**

```
za
```

**Sample Output 1**

```
Bad String
```
