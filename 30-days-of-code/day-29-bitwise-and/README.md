# Day 29: Bitwise AND

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-bitwise-and

### Problem

Welcome to the last day! Today, we're discussing bitwise operations.  

**Task**

Given set S = { 1, 2, 3, ..., N }. 
Find two integers, A and B (where A < B), from set S such that the value of A&B is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, K. 
In this case, & represents the bitwise AND operator.

**Input format**

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.  
Each of the T subsequent lines defines a test case as 2 space-separated integers, N and K, respectively.

**Output Format**

For each test case, print the maximum possible value of A&B on a new line.

**Sample Input**

```
3
5 2
8 5
2 2
```

**Sample Output**

```
1
4
0
```
