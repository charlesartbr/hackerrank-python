# Day 6: Let's Review

### Problem

**Objective**

Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what we've already learned about loops.

**Task**

Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N - 1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

**Note:** 0 is considered to be an even index.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a String, S.

**Output Format**

For each String Sj (where 0 <= j <= T - 1), print Sj's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by Sj's odd-indexed characters.

**Sample Input**

```
2
Hacker
Rank
```

**Sample Output**

```
Hce akr
Rn ak
```
