https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-2d-arrays

### Problem

**Objective**  

Today, we're building on our knowledge of Arrays by adding another dimension. 

**Task**

Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in A, then print the maximum hourglass sum.

**Input Format**

There are 6 lines of input, where each line contains 6 space-separated integers describing 2D Array A; every value in A will be in the inclusive range of -9 to 9.

**Output Format**

Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in A.

**Sample Input**

```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0
```

**Sample Output**
