# Day 5: Loops

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-loops

### Problem

**Objective**

In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

**Task**

Given an integer, n, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n x i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

**Input Format**

A single integer, n.

**Output Format**

Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1 <= i <= 10) contains the result of n x 1 in the form:
n x i = result.

**Sample Input**

```
2
```

**Sample Output**

```
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
```
