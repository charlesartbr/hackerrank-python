# Day 14: Scope

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-scope

### Problem

**Objective**  

Today we're discussing scope.  
 
The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as |a - b|. The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in elements.  

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (elements) for storing N non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

**Task**

Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

- A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the elements instance variable.
- A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in N and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.

**Input Format**

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in your editor reads in 2 lines of input; the first line contains elements, and the second line describes the elements array.

**Output Format**

You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print the value of the maximumDifference instance variable.

**Sample Input**

```
3
1 2 5
```

**Sample Output**

```
4
```
