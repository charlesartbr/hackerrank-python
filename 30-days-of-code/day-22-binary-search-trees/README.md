# Day 22: Binary Search Trees

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-search-trees

### Problem

**Objective**  

Today, we're working with Binary Search Trees (BSTs).

**Task**

The height of a binary search tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. You are given a pointer, root, pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the getHeight function provided in your editor so that it returns the height of the binary search tree.

**Input Format**

The locked stub code in your editor reads the following inputs and assembles them into a binary search tree:  
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.  
Each of the n subsequent lines contains an integer, data, denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.

**Output Format**

The locked stub code in your editor will print the integer returned by your getHeight function denoting the height of the BST.

**Sample Input**

```
7
3
5
2
1
4
6
7
```

**Sample Output**

```
3
```
