# Day 1: Data Types

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types

### Problem

**Objective**

Today, we're discussing data types.

**Task**

Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
3. Use the  operator to perform the following operations:
    a. Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
    b. Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    c. Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer that you must sum with i.
The second line contains a double that you must sum with d.
The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with s.

**Output Format**

Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles (scaled to 1 decimal place) on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.
