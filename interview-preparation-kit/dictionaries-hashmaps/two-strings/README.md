### Problem

Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.  

For example, the words "a", "and", "art" share the common substring **a**. The words "be" and "cat" do not share a substring.  

**Function Description**  

Complete the function twoStrings in the editor below. It should return a string, either YES or NO based on whether the strings share a common substring.

twoStrings has the following parameter(s):

- s1, s2: two strings to analyze.

**Input Format**  

The first line contains a single integer **p**, the number of test cases.  

The following **p** pairs of lines are as follows:  

- The first line contains string **s1**.  
- The second line contains string **s2**.  

**Output Format**

For each pair of strings, return YES or NO.  

**Sample Input 0**

```
2
hello
world
hi
world
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
YES
NO
```
