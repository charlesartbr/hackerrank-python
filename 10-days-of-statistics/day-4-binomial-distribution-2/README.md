# Day 4: Binomial Distribution II

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-binomial-distribution-2

### Problem

In this challenge, we go further with binomial distributions. 

**Task**

A manufacturer of metal pistons finds that, on average, 12% of the pistons they manufacture are rejected because they are incorrectly sized. What is the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain:  
   
No more than 2 rejects?  
At least 2 rejects?  

**Input Format**

A single line containing the following values (denoting the respective percentage of defective pistons and the size of the current batch of pistons):

```
12 10
```

**Output Format**. 

Print the answer to each question on its own line:   

1. The first line should contain the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain no more than 2 rejects.  
2. The second line should contain the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain at least 2 rejects. 
  
Round both of your answers to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).
