https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-binomial-distribution-1

### Problem

In this challenge, we learn about binomial distributions.

**Task**

The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is 1.09:1. 
If there is 1 child born per birth, what proportion of Russian families with exactly 6 children will have at least 3 boys?

Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. 
Then print your result, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).

**Input Format**

A single line containing the following values:

```
1.09 1
```

### My Solution
