# Day 0: Mean, Median, and Mode

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-weighted-mean

### Problem

In the previous challenge, we calculated a mean. In this challenge, we practice calculating a weighted mean.

**Task**

Given an array, X, of N integers and an array, W, representing the respective weights of X's elements, calculate and print the weighted mean of X's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in arrays X and W.  
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array X.  
The third line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array W.

**Output Format**

Print the weighted mean on a new line. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,  12.3 format).

**Sample Input 0**

```
5
10 40 30 50 20
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
32.0
```
